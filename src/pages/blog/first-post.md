## Welcome to the Chaos

This is my first blog post on this newly designed website. The goal was to make something **brutalist**, **minimal**, and **fast**.

### Why Brutalism?

Because I like:
- Heavy borders
- Monospace fonts
- No distractions

Here is some code just to test the styling:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Enjoy the stay!
