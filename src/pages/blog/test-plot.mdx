## Code Typography Test

Here is some Python code to generate a chart. It should be in **Fira Code** font with ligatures (if enabled) and visible in dark mode.

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import json

fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3, 4], y=[10, 15, 13, 17]))
fig.write_json("public/plots/sample.json")
```

## Interactive Plot

Below is the plot rendered from the JSON file:

<Plotly src="/plots/sample.json" />

Enjoy the data!
